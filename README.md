# My Project Name === Ticket To Train


## About Project 

This project is all about **authentication**. As I am a new learner in this field, I have faced so many difficulties while doing the project.I have used React Router through out the project also private router. Using **Fake Data** I have loaded data and show various information as it can be more user friendly to show and to read. Also I have designed the ui using **bootstrap, React Bootstrap and Material UI**. It's not very good to use more than one framework for design but as I am exploring my creativity also that's why I have done this. In this project you will get two way of sign up/ register and log in.I have used **FontAwesome icons** for better interaction. I hope you will love it and surely I will develop it by adding new features in future.
